          <h2 id="header1">What is AI?</h2>

          <p><strong>AI</strong>: Stands for Artificial Intelligence</p>
          <p>The term &quot;<em>artificial intelligence</em>&quot; is used to describe the ability of machines to
              learn and problem solve, to essentially mimic humans by using specialised algorithms <sup>[1]</sup>.
              AI is simply an umbrella term that covers all of its subsets. AI can describe many different systems
              from Machine Learning to Deep Learning. However, all its subsets and definitions share one common
              attribute. They all allow machines to mimic human intelligence.</p>

          <h2 id="header2">AI is on the rise but should it be?</h2>

          <p>All data presented is received from the Google Trends™ API (<strong>A</strong>pplication

              public's
              interest in AI. As a disclaimer, I do not claim ownership of any data presented here and I am using
              it under the &#39;Fair Dealing&#39; law governed by Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and

          <ul>
              <li>If the use is for the purposes of research or private study;</li>
              <li>If it is used for the purposes of criticism, review or quotation;</li>
              <li>Where it is utilised for the purposes of reporting current events (this does not apply to
                  photographs)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In this case, I am using the data solely for research purposes to demonstrate, as stated earlier, the
              public's interest in AI.</p>

          <p>Using Google&#39;s API to gather data from the Google trends data analysis, and python 3 with modules
              <strong><em>&#39;pandas&#39;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#39;pytrends&#39;</em></strong>, I
              searched for specific key phrases and plotted them in the graphs below to show recent public
              interest in the subjects and to show, in recent years, how the public has come to view AI and its

          <p>Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and
              time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half
              as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term. Again, all of this data was
              retrieved from Google™ and therefore abides by Google&#39;s chosen numerical scale.</p>

          <p>To learn the basics of data analysis, go to the Open University&#39;s free course: <a
                  href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/learn-code-data-analysis/content-section-overview-0"
                  target="breach">Learn
                  to code for data analysis</a></p>

          <p>As shown in <em>figure 1</em>, in the last 5 years especially, there has been an exponential increase
              in the searches of what AI is and therefore how it functions. This data suggests that the public
              is becoming increasingly interested in AI technology which can lead to an increase in the production of
              AI designs as people of all ages find out and begin their own research into the subject as well as funding for the industry.</p>

          <p>Now we plot the next graph:</p>
          <div
              style="background: #272822; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">
              <pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #f8f8f2">PlotGraph(</span><span style="color: #e6db74">&quot;artificial intelligence in healthcare&quot;</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">)</span>
</pre>
          </div>


          <figure class="figure text-center">
            <img src="../../img/HealthAI.png" class="zoom figure-img img-fluid" title="Graph showing the recent interest in AI in healthcare"
            alt="Graph showing the recent interest in AI">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Recent search history of &quot;Artificial intelligence in healthcare&quot; from Google
              Trends™</em></figcaption><p class="text-muted small">(Hover to zoom)</p>
          </figure>
          <p>Surprisingly, this data co-aligns with the data in <em>figure 1</em>, which shows public interest in
              what AI is. From 2017 onwards (<em>figure 2</em> ), there is also an exponential increase in search
              results which could suggest that people who are learning about AI are also becoming more aware of it
              being used in healthcare. AI is used in all types of treatments, from
              radiotherapy to radiology and due to this, more people are researching AI, which can be a double
              edged sword, as this can be both
              beneficial and harmful. On one hand, there is reason to believe more people are becoming health
              literate in this age of technology and, with reason to assume, are providing themselves with better
              autonomous care by looking into treatments. </p>

          <p>However, this could also backfire, as “Google” and most
              search engines are fundamentally biased due to implementing search algorithms that cater towards
              whichever site is most popular. This means that repeated searches can lead to a patient reading
              something that is completely wrong which may distort their judgement on a treatment by providing
              either
              false,
              non-specific, or not applicable information.</p>

          <p>Moreover, in <em>figure 3</em>, there are searches in recent years that ask the question “is AI
              dangerous?”. Suggesting that a number of people still do not necessarily trust AI as of yet and a
              big reason for this may be due to them not knowing what AI is. With <em>figure 1</em> and
              <em>3</em>, it tells us that there are a number of people that both don&#39;t know or
              understand what AI is and are scared of it. So while AI is on the rise, the
              untrustworthiness of it is also rising as bias search engines lead people to sites that
              are against AI as well as those that are pro-AI.</p>
          <p>If a patient went into a consultation and found that AI or a robot was the best solution and was
              being used in their
              surgery and due to this they rejected the treatment, then both their quality and quantity of life is
              at
              risk. This is hazardous to public health and should be addressed. Computing and technology are
              becoming increasingly vital in this day and age and therefore should be taught in more detail to the
              general public to reduce the risk of situations like this occurring. </p>

          </figure>

          <p>Fortunately, <em>in figure 4</em>, there is a much larger increase in search results for the
              advantages of AI than the dangers of it. Showing that, while AI is on the rise, it’s not all bad, as
              there are people out there researching the benefits of AI and how it can potentially help them.</p>
          <p>This data demonstrates that while AI and AI technology is on the rise, It&#39;s not as dangerous as
              it seems, as there are people out there trying to understand it and with understanding comes
              acceptance and growth. Which can lead to more advancements in AI technology and its subsets due
              to the amount of interest and further funding it may likely get in the future due to this.</p>
          <h2 id="header3">AI In Everyday Life</h2>

          <p>AI, and its subset Machine Learning, has a large variety of applications in daily life. One famous
              example is the
              self driving car. With companies like Tesla™ at the forefront of it all, AI and machine learning are
              being used and perfected everyday to provide safer cars and cause fewer accidents on the road. With
              self-driving cars, all cars could communicate with each other and therefore know where each vehicle
              was going, which could drastically reduce the risk of car accidents. They can calculate operations
              millions of times faster than the human brain <sup>[2]</sup> can and as a result, reduce the risk of
              pedestrian and bicycle accidents.</p>
          <p>Another example is robots, you may not expect it but even machines in your house use AI. The iRobot
              Roomba 980™ model vacuum uses AI technology <sup>[3]</sup> to scan a room&#39;s area size and look
              for the most efficient path to clean as well as avoid obstacles on the way. It can also assess the
              amount of cleaning it&#39;s required to do by the size of the room. Larger rooms require less
              cleaning cycles while smaller ones, which get dirtier faster, get more. This is just one of the ways
              AI is being used in everyday life and Its ability to problem solve is continuously evolving.</p>
              <h2 id="header4">How does AI benefit our health?</h2>
                        
              <figure class="figure float-right text-center">

                        </figure>
                        <p>This picture above is an example of how AI can be used to better modern medicine. The computer
                          software automatically calculated the bone age and therefore the age of the patient. This provides a
                          fast and easy way to gauge a person&#39;s age who may not know it themselves, e.g. a patient with
                          amnesia.</p>
                    
          <p>AI is used everywhere, especially in radiology and surgery. AI’s ability to interpret imaging from
              radiology can aid health care professionals in identifying even the most minuscule change in a scan
              that may have been missed previously.</p>
          <h3 id="subheader1">AI used in detection of COVID - 19</h3>
          <p>AI can even be used to differentiate COVID - 19 from pneumonia. In a paper done by the Department of
              Radiology in
              Wuhan, China <sup>[4]</sup>, AI was used to create a fully automatic framework to detect COVID - 19
              using chest CT scans to distinguish it from pneumonia, which has similar symptoms to COVID - 19. It
              used deep learning, a subset of
              AI, to create an artificial neural network that used data sets of CT scans of patients with COVID -
              19 and ones with just community acquired pneumonia. It used logical decision making and thinking to
              learn how COVID - 19 symptoms may differ from standard pneumonia and this experiment resulted in a
              96% accuracy in deducing which CT scans showed COVID -19 and a 95% accuracy for which CT scan showed
              community acquired pneumonia.</p>
          <p>This demonstrated that a deep learning model can accurately detect COVID - 19. This technology could
              potentially save millions as it can reduce the risk of infection as patients with COVID - 19 can be
              detected faster and quarantined appropriately, minimising exposure to others.</p>
          <h3 id="subheader2">AI used in detection of Skin Cancers</h3>
          <p>AI can also be used in surgery. In 2018, a paper published by the Annals of Oncology<sup> [5]</sup>, deep
              learning
              was also used in creating a neural network trained specifically on dermoscopic images. 100 cases of
              skin cancers and benign lesions were used to help teach the machine to learn the differences between
              different types of skin cancers and how to detect them. </p>
          <p>This resulted in a 95% accuracy rate for the neural network whereas the dermatologists diagnosed it
              with an accuracy of 94%. While the specialists were outperformed in this experiment, the researchers
              themselves suspect that it may have been due to the artificial conditions of the lab and that in a
              less artificial environment, the dermatologists and neural networks may have performed on the same
              level.</p>
          <p>As you can suspect, some specialists see the advancements of AI as a threat <sup>[6]</sup> as its
              evolution to create a more accurate algorithm may result in improvements of diagnosis compared to
              ones done by the specialists.</p>
          <p>Even Google™ has dabbled with medical AI, with their company DeepMind <sup>[7]</sup>. The NHS uses
              DeepMind to identify health threats from data obtained over a smartphone device. </p>

          <h2 id="header5">Conclusion</h2>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline">Why am I talking about AI?</p>
          <p>Well as you can see from the data above, Machine learning, Deep learning and AI have become of
            interest in recent years, however, some of the connotations associated with them are negative.</p>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline">Is AI really dangerous?</p>
          <p>AI isn't as dangerous as it may sound, it can
              improve and benefit our lives in so many ways. Technology is only going to become more advanced as time
              progresses, so it is important to learn about technology now to gain a deeper understanding of the world
              we live in.</p>
